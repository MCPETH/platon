Before installing PLATON, it is highly recommended to have a fast linear
algebra library (BLAS) and verify that numpy is linked to it.  This is because
the heart of the radiative transfer code is a matrix multiplication operation
conducted through numpy.dot, which in turn calls a BLAS library if it can find
one.  If it can't find one, your code will be many times slower.

On Linux, a good choice is OpenBLAS. You can install it on Ubuntu with::
  
  sudo apt install libopenblas-dev

On OS X, a good choice is Accelerate/vecLib, which should already be installed
by default.

To check if your numpy is linked to BLAS, do::

  numpy.__config__.show()

If blas_opt_info mentions OpenBLAS or vecLib, that's a good sign.  If it says
"NOT AVAILABLE", that's a bad sign.

Once you have a BLAS installed and linked to numpy, download PLATON,
install the requirements, and install PLATON itself.  The easiest way is to
use pip::

  pip install platon

That's it!  Because PyPI has a size limit on packages, this will not install
the data files.  The data files will be automatically downloaded when PLATON is
first run.  The default data files have a wavelength resolution of R=1000, but
if you want higher resolution, you can download R=2000 and R=10,000 data from
`this webpage <http://astro.caltech.edu/~mz/absorption.html>`_

Another option is to install from source::

  git clone https://github.com/ideasrule/platon.git
  cd platon/
  python setup.py install

In this case, you can run unit tests to make sure everything works::
  
  nosetests -v 

The unit tests should also give you a good idea of how fast the code will be.
On a decent Ubuntu machine with OpenBLAS, it takes 2 minutes.

If you have a CUDA-capable GPU and plan to use the eclipse depth calculator,
you can take advantage of GPU acceleration.  Install CUDA, cudamat, and gnumpy,
in that order, and the eclipse depth calculator should automatically use
find and use gnumpy.
